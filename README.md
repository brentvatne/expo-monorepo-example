# expo-monorepo-example

Demonstrates integration with `expo-yarn-workspaces`, to have apps inside the `apps` directory and shared libs in the `packages` directory.

Mostly just following the `expo-yarn-workspaces` README after creating a minimal `package.json` in the root, as described by the Yarn workspaces documentation.
